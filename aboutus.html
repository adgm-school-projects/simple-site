<p> The <strong>Just OK Gamers</strong> family of content revolves around a single fundamental principle: That everyone that enjoys video games is a gamer, regardless of age, gender, creed or ability. Whether you're an ace of the arena or a weekend warrior with a baby in one arm and a joystick in the other, we're here to help you enjoy the hobby through immature humor and joint appreciation of having a good time.</p>

<a href="http://justokgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Gweedo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-248" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" src="http://justokgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Gweedo-184x300.jpg" alt="Gweedo" width="184" height="300" /></a><h4>Gweedo</h4>

<p>Gweedo has been playing video games for the last 20 years. Your average nerd with an appreciation for mixed media, he merged his skills as an amateur filmmaker and creative mind with his experience in gaming to develop the Just OK Guides for League of Legends.

Playing off that success, he gathered a group of misfits and rogues to create Just OK Gamers, a community of average dudes with average skill sets and above-average wits to waste time talking about games, movies, comics, and everything in between.</p>

<a href="http://justokgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/wallybio.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-249" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" src="http://justokgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/wallybio-184x300.jpg" alt="wallybio" width="184" height="300" /></a><h4>Wally</h4>

<p>A comrade of Gweedo's for almost a decade, Wally brings a shade of immature irrelevancy coupled with a Rainman-like knowledge of gaming history to the table. He is a champion of technology's ability to allow man to conduct business from the toilet.

Raised on an Amiga and LucasArts titles, Wally has been writing about and playing video games for the last 20 years. A PC Gamer at heart, he plays any game regardless of obscurity.

Despite these accolades, he considers the highlight of his career to be accidentally backing up and subsequently falling into John Romero's arms at E3. The legends about his hair at that time are <em>completely true. </em>In fact, Wally believes the incident was the inspiration for <em>Daikatana</em>.</p>

<p>If Just OK Gamers was a young british pop band, Milpool would be the quiet, sensitive one the girls swoon over. Milpool has the questionably distinguished honor in being the only civilized member of the team due to his reserved demeanor and Canadian citizenship.

Milpool is the veteran of several years of competitive gaming in several genres, and is a friend and associate of Wally and Gweedo going back over a decade. He is definitely the voice of reason in the midst of knuckleheads here at Just OK Gamers.

He follows the League of Legends community and newswire with a keen eye, and is often able to provide some unique insight. Plus, he keeps Gweedo in check.</p>

<p>Nasty has been playing video games for the past 6 years, starting when he joined the Marine Corp. He was a bored individual without many friends so he started playing World of Warcraft, which we all know is a time sink. This lead him to League of Legends and branched out from there.

Nasty possesses a cold, calculated mind that embraces all the subtle tactical nuances to be a League of Legends champion. Or so we're told.

Since getting out of the Marine Corp. he has started going to college and screws around with this group of gamers, a few of which are on the podcast.</p>

<p>Caiters’ gaming career began in ’95, when she first picked up a Sega Genesis controller and played Sonic, Earthworm Jim, and her favorite, Road Rash.

When not sinking her time into the Fields of Justice over at League of Legends, Caiters is a full time art student who aspires to work in the entertainment industry, to contribute to the game studios she loves the most.

People often ask Caiters, “How do you get such a rosy glow to your cheeks, why does your hair smell like strawberries?” The answer is simple. Eight hours of sleeps a night, and strawberry shampoo. If gaming and art doesn’t work out, Caiters will most likely take up professional Corgi breeding. Those dogs are really cute.</p>
